# Contact Serverless • Practice

This is a minimal practice project to deploy a contact form to **Railway** using a **Node.js Express server**.

## Files
- `index.html` — Simple contact form posting to `/api/contact`.
- `server.js` — Express server that serves the contact API and static files.
- `package.json` — Project config and start script for Railway.

## Local Setup
```bash
npm install
npm start         # http://localhost:3000
```

## Deploy to Railway
1. Push your code to GitHub.
2. Go to [Railway](https://railway.app/), create a new project, and connect your repo.
3. Railway will auto-detect Node.js and deploy your app.

## Verify
- Submit the form on your deployed Railway site.
- Check logs in the Railway dashboard for submissions.
